# Rotatoes
## About
It's a video game! Where you rotate things.
It's the Racing Thru Time game Eli and Sarah and I made for GDS like a million years ago...
But it's in Pico-8.
Wanted to try and make something in it. For fun :0

## Setup/Build
This game uses `pico-build` to compile lua files to a `.p8` cart. Instructions on how to set it up can be found [here](https://github.com/ianjsikes/pico-build).
